# Baileys Catastrophe
 A game developed for CSCI 485
 Originally a group project hosted at: https://github.com/MuckerMayhem/485-baby-game
 
 Bailey's Catastrophe starts Bailey as she is left with a choice to 
 defend her homeland from alien invaders or search for the treasure
 that the aliens have invaded for.

 After developing this game, I wish to remake it now after learning several
 lessons from the original development.

 Some of these changes involve implementing a state machine for Bailey,
 redoing the graphic style, revamping the physics system and more.
